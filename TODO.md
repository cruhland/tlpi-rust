- Soon
  - Exercise 4-2, copy file with holes
    - Extend file if there are zero bytes at the end
    - Simplify code, get rid of println! calls
    - Allow implementation to use new SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE params
- Later
  - Get rid of deprecation warnings for std::os::errno()
    - Either get direct access to the errno value,
    - or determine the UNIX error name from std::io::Error
  - Provide script for generating the `ENAME` array in `err.rs`
  - Provide script for generating tlpi_rust::util::OpenFlags from a C header file
