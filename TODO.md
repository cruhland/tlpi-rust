- Clean up util.rs syscall functions
  - Make fd a newtype
  - Use semantically meaningful int types (e.g., usize vs. u32)
  - Use impl to make open, read, write, and close methods of fd
  - Use move semantics to avoid an explicit close() call
- See if we can use move semantics to avoid reusing the buffer
